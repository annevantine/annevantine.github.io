              Chatham Light</h2>
            <p class="head2">The <a href="http://www.lighthouse.cc/chatham/index.html">Chatham 
              Light</a> is on Main Street overlooking South Beach. Day and night, 
              the light sends out two flashes every ten seconds. This is a good 
              place to go after dinner and be hypnotized by the light flashes 
              and the surf on the beach. It's most dramatic on a foggy night with 
              a full moon rising. For a nice photo of the Light, see <a href="http://www.elohi.com/photo/lighthouse/">Jay 
              Pulli' s</a> web site.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="beaches.html"><img src="images/beachicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="beaches" border="0"></a>South 
              Beach</h2>
            <p class="head2">In front of the Chatham Light, South Beach faces 
              the Atlantic. It extends a long tail south that invites you to keep 
              walking on and on with bare feet in the cool surf. Most of South 
              Beach was an island until a few years ago, when the shifting sands 
              reconnected it with the mainland near the Chatham Light. If you 
              want to get out to the end the easy way, Outermost Harbor Marine 
              offers shuttles to South Beach from Seagull Road (945-2030).</p>
            <h2 class="acthead">Morris Island and Monomoy Wildlife Refuge</h2>
            <p class="head2"><a href="walking.html"><img src="images/walkicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="walking" border="0"></a>Morris 
              Island, now a scenic penninsula, houses the <a href="http://www.capecodconnection.com/monomoy/"> 
              Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge</a> headquarters. A charming nature 
              trail of a little over a mile leads out to a long flight of steps 
              down to a beach. The refuge includes North and South Monomoy Islands 
              and part of Morris Island. To get there from the Chatham Light, 
              follow Main St south to Morris Island Rd. </p>
            <h2 class="acthead">Stage Harbor View from The Neck</h2>
            <p class="head2">Be sure to bicycle, drive or walk out Stage Harbor 
              Rd to &quot;The Neck&quot; for wonderful views of Stage Harbor.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="walking.html"><img src="images/walkicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="walking" border="0"></a>Main 
              Street</h2>
            <p class="head2">Chatham has a vibrant Main Street for walking and 
              gawking. At the opposite end of the spectrum from Provincetown, 
              Chatham's Main Street exudes conservative good taste. Everything 
              is pretty and the stores offer art, books, handcrafted gifts, fine 
              clothes, and much more. I counted five ice-cream stores, but my 
              favorite lunch is fresh seafood in the cool pub atmosphere of the 
              Chatham Squire.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="sightseeing.html"><img src="images/windmill.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="sightseeing" border="0"></a>Chatham's 
              Old Grist Mill</h2>
            <p class="head2">This mill is near Chase Park, off Shattuck Place, 
              high on a hill. It normally is open 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the summer</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="beaches.html"><img src="images/beachicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="beaches" border="0"></a>Oyster 
              Pond</h2>
            <p class="head2">Oyster Pond is a salt-water pond at the end of a 
              deep inlet connecting to Stage Harbor. The public beach is a good 
              place for a swim. At Queen Anne Rd and Pond Rd.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="bicycling.html"><img src="images/bikeicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="bicycling" border="0"></a>Chatham 
              Bicycle Ride</h2>
            <p class="head2">Chatham is one of my favorite places for a bicycle 
              ride. The rail trail bypasses Chatham. However, if you can put up 
              with some traffic, hills, and Chatham's ubiquitous wind, you'll 
              ride into striking picture postcard views around every corner. The 
              route, described in <i><a href="bicycling.html">Short 
              Bike Rides,</a></i> follows the coast around Chatham's beaches, 
              harbors, and inlets. In addition, Fox Hill Road to Nickerson Neck 
              gives some great views of Pleasant Bay and a fine golf course overlooking 
              the bay.</p>

              Harbor Light</a> stands alone on a sand penninsula, surrounded by 
              Nantucket Sound, the entrance to Stage Harbor, and the Oyster River 
              inlet. On the flat, sandy trail out to the lighthouse from Hardings 
              Beach, you see birds and grasses and beach plum, and the water off 
              to your right. As you approach the building, you may glimpse sailboats 
              behind it on Oyster River. It's two miles round trip through the 
              sand, described in the <i><a href="walking.html">Short Nature Walks</a> 
              </i>book. Start at Hardings Beach, at the end of Hardings Road, 
              and return to the beach to relax. </p>

              Nantucket Sound at Ridgevale Beach</h2>
            <p class="head2">If you want to go boating in the open waters, Cape 
              Water Sports rents sailboats, power boats, and surfbikes and kayaks 
              at Ridgevale Beach on Nantucket Sound (432-4339). It's just west 
              of Hardings Beach, and you can sail up to the Stage Harbor light 
              that you may have visited on foot. To get there, heading west on 
              Rte 28, turn left onto Ridgevale Beach. It's a good place to spend 
              the day on the beach, too.</p>

              Island Tours</h2>
            <p class="head2"> North and South Monomoy Islands are part of the 
              <a href="http://www.capecodconnection.com/monomoy/">Monomoy National 
              Wildlife Refuge.</a> Boat tours to the islands are offered by <a href="tours.html#wildlife">Wellfleet 
              Bay Wildlife Sanctuary</a> and the <a href="tours.html#museum">Cape 
              Cod Museum of Natural History</a>. The half-day trips to North Monomoy 
              give you a chance to beachcomb and see the birds and the seals. 
              Cape Cod Museum also offers a 1-hour cruise around North Monomoy 
              just to view the seals.</p>
            <p class="head2">South Monomoy is six miles out into Nantucket Sound 
              and the Atlantic. I've taken the all-day tour. We walked through 
              tidal pools and marshes and grasses for a mile and a half to the 
              Monomoy Lighthouse, learning from the guide about the birds and 
              wildlife, nature, and history. Cape Cod Museum also offers a trip 
              where you stay overnight at the lighthouse keeper's house</p>

              You can rent a boat and explore on your own, or take part in a sponsored 
              canoe or cruise trip. Both the National Seashore and Wellfleet Bay 
              Wildlife Sanctuary sponsor canoe trips. The Wildlife Sanctuary and 
              Cape Cod Museum of Natural History sponsor guided cruises to learn 
              about the birds and wildlife, and trek around on the beaches of 
              the Bay's islands.</p>
            <p class="head2">At the elegant Wequassett Inn, Cape Water Sports 
              rents sailboats, power boats, surfbikes and kayaks. Call 432-5400, 
              x530. Sailboats include the very simple little Escape sailboat or 
              the fast Hobie Cat Wave, as well as larger Daysailers. You can rent 
              for an hour or up to a day. Park at the lower level lot at the Wequassett 
              Inn and walk through their resort pool area to the boat rentals. 
              Combine a sail with a perfect lunch on the inn's dining room patio 
              overlooking the Bay. The Wequassett is at the intersection of Rte 
              28 and Pleasant Bay Road.</p>

            <p class="head2">Salt water to swim in as warm as a pond is the appeal 
              of Pleasant Bay beaches. There's a nice beach on Pleasant Bay just 
              off Rte 28, just a bit south of the Wequassett Inn. There also are 
              are couple of town landings on Nickerson Neck (around Fox Hill Road) 
              that look like they would be fine for swimming in Pleasant Bay</p>
