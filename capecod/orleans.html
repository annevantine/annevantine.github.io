              Young Windmill Park</h2>
            <p class="head2"> Restored and maintained by the Orleans Historical 
              Society, the windmill is all set up to grind corn. Every day from 
              June to September, a volunteer will guide you through the mill and 
              explain its history and operation. The park around the mill is a 
              nice place to relax and watch the sailboats in Town Cove. Located 
              at Rte 28 and 6A. </p>
            <p class="head2">You can walk to the nearby Orleans Inn and have lunch 
              on the deck or by the picture window looking out onto Town Cove. 
              Interesting nearby stores to browse in are the Goose Hummock Shop 
              next to the Inn, and the Birdwatchers' General Store, 36 Rte 6A. 
              Combine this excursion with a cruise of Nauset Marsh.</p>

              Marsh Cruise</h2>
            <p class="head2">Nauset Marsh covers a large inlet between Orleans 
              and Eastham. Orleans Town Cove is at the inner reaches of the marsh 
              to the south. <a href="tours.html#wildlife">Wellfleet Bay Wildlife 
              Sanctuary</a> sponsors a cruise of Nauset Marsh in a pontoon boat, 
              leaving from Town Cove. The boat silently sneaks up on one of the 
              largest tern colonies in Massachusetts, and the tales of the birds' 
              migrations will fascinate and amaze. Sliding through the channels 
              between the mazes of marsh grass to the outer beaches is a wonderful 
              way to spend a summer afternoon.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="sightseeing.html"><img src="images/bldgicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="sightseeing" border="0"></a>The 
              French Cable Museum</h2>
            <p class="head2">Having a husband with a radio hobby led me to spend 
              an afternoon at the French Cable Museum. It was really quite interesting. 
              A knowledgeable volunteer showed us around and then we were left 
              to browse the plethora of artifacts. At Cove Rd and Rte 128, 255-0343</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="beaches.html"><img src="images/beachicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="beaches" border="0"></a>Nauset 
              Beach</h2>
            <p class="head2">Nauset Beach faces east toward the Atlantic Ocean. 
              The water is cold and the waves are high. It's what most people 
              think of when you say &quot;beach&quot;. Follow Main St until it 
              becomes Beach St and go to the end. Nauset Beach extends as a long 
              sandy penninsula south to Chatham, and forms the barrier that protects 
              Pleasant Bay. To drive down the beach, you need a permit from the 
              town and a vehicle that won't get stuck in the sand.. Returning 
              from Nauset Beach, we like to stop at Kadee's Clam Bar for a snack 
              of strawberry champagne drinks with rawbar oysters and littleneck 
              clams.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="bicycling.html"><img src="images/bikeicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="bicycling" border="0"></a>Bicycling 
              Tonset</h2>
            <p class="head2">Looking at a map of all Orleans' harbors, coves, 
              marshes, bays, and inlets, it's clear there must be many water scenes 
              to view by bicycle. The Tonset area above Nauset Beach offers glimpses 
              of Town Cove and Nauset Marsh as well as several town landings that 
              take you right to the water. If you're inclined to take a swim, 
              the salt water is warm and protected. It's a residential area with 
              minimal traffic. Looking at a map, go out Tonset Road and Brick 
              Hill Road, and then explore all the smaller roads that lead to water.</p>

              Harbor fishing port on Cape Cod Bay seems oblivious to the tourists 
              (although it may be a special place for the sports fishing tourist). 
              That fresh seafood coming in on the boats hurries right into Capt'n 
              Cass's kitchen in Rock Harbor. It's the freshest and most tasty, 
              and the best value for seafood lunches and dinners. I saw a reference 
              to a beach at the harbor -- if you can find it, you would probably 
              have it to yourself. The harbor is located at the end of Rock Harbor 
              Road. </p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="beaches.html"><img src="images/beachicon.gif" width="70" height="70" align="right" alt="beaches" border="0"></a>Skaket 
              Beach Sunsets</h2>
            <p class="head2">Skaket Beach on Cape Cod Bay is east ofRock Harbor, 
              but you get there by following Skaket Beach Road. This is my favorite 
              place to watch a sunset. Check the tide chart and plan for an evening 
              when the tide will be at its lowest at sunset. The long flat beach 
              gets a pattern of tidal pools that reflect the colors from the sky. 
              Get a few walkers in the picture, and it calls out for your camera. 
              There's even a tower to climb to improve your view. It's hard to 
              choose whether to walk way way out in bare feet toward the setting 
              sun, or stay on the tower and take pictures. </p>

              Trail Gap</h2>
            <p class="head2">The rail trail has a gap in Orleans. Coming from 
              Brewster, the trail ends at Main St and Old Colony Way. The recommended 
              bicycle route takes you down Rock Harbor Rd to the harbor and then 
              continues on Rock Harbor Rd to rejoin the trail. </p>

              Point on Pleasant Bay</h2>
            <p class="head2"><img src="images/pleasantbaycard.jpg" width="175" height="124" align="left" alt=" Pleasant Bay &quot;River&quot;">Kent's 
              Point is at the upper reaches of Little Pleasant Bay where it narrows 
              and they call it &quot;The River&quot;. The town of Orleans recently 
              acquired it as conservation land. Trails take you around the edges 
              of the point for wonderful views of the bay's natural beauty. In 
              at least one place you could take a swim in the warm salt water 
              if you can brave a little salt grass muck. The <a href="tours.html#seashore">National 
              Seashor</a>e conducts a tour of Kent's Point. From Monument Road, 
              follow signs to Kent's Point starting at Frost Fish Lane.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="boating.html"><img src="images/boaticon.gif" align="right" alt="boating" width="70" height="70" border="0"></a>Sailing 
              Lessons at Arey's Pond</h2>
            <p class="head2">In the same neighborhood, down Arey's Lane from Rte 
              28, Arey's Pond shelters many boats in salt water. This too is part 
              of Little Pleasant Bay, up &quot;The River&quot; to &quot;Namequoit 
              River&quot; which leads to the pond. Arey's Pond Boatyard builds 
              sailboats and can answer just about any boating questions. I took 
              a week of sailing lessons at Arey's, which was fun and taught me 
              a lot about sailing and Pleasant Bay.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="beaches.html"><img src="images/beachicon.gif" align="right" alt="beaches" width="70" height="70" border="0"></a><a href="walking.html"><img src="images/walkicon.gif" align="right" alt="walking" width="70" height="70" border="0"></a>Pah 
              Wah Point on Pleasant Bay</h2>
            <p class="head2">I seldom see another person in these twelve acres 
              of town conservation land in South Orleans. There's a trail with 
              markers and a brochure expaining the natural history points. The 
              trail leads to a picnic table in a lovely setting looking onto Pleasant 
              Bay and a marshy beach that you can have to yourself. The water 
              is warm and sheltered. At the end of Namequoit Road, off Rte 28.</p>
            <h2 class="acthead"><a href="bicycling.html"><img src="images/bikeicon.gif" align="right" alt="bicycling" width="70" height="70" border="0"></a>Bicycling 
              Monument St and South Orleans</h2>
            <p class="head2">The area along Little Pleasant Bay from Monument 
              Street to South Orleans is challenging, but takes you to idyllic 
              points along the water. The game is to find backroads that avoid 
              Rte 28, a horrible place for bicycles. This requires a street map. 
              Starting from Main St, follow Monument Rd. Ride out to see Kent's 
              Point and back, then follow Kescayoganset Rd to Arey's Lane. A dirt 
              road takes you around Pilgrim Lake to Arey's Pond. Then, the only 
              way to get to Namequoit is very carefully for a quarter mile on 
              Rte 28. Namequoit goes to Paw Wah Point, and Heritage Drive takes 
              you to Portanimicut, which connects to Quanset. The town landing 
              at the end of Portanimicut looks out onto Little Pleasant Bay, while 
              the scene at the end of Quanset looks south toward Chatham across 
              big Pleasant Bay. All the return trips strengthen your legs with 
              big climbs.</p>
