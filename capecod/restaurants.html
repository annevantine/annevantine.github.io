<h3 class="rest">Beechcroft Inn <span class="restaddr">1360 Rte 6A, 
              896-9534</span></h3>
            <p>My best new find with a new chef the summer of 1999. Smoked fish 
              chowder with crunchy corn was wonderful. Then it stopped serving 
              dinner, but I see it on the web so it may be back in 2002.</p>
                              

 <h3 class="rest">Bramble Inn<span class="restaddr">                        2019 Rte 6A

                </span></h3>
          
                  <p>Fixed price for a 3-course dinner. Perhaps overly formal 
                    and expensive, but pleasant. </p>

 <h3 class="rest">Brewster Fish House<span class="restaddr">                        2208 Rte 6A, 
                    896-7867
                </span></h3>          
                  
            <p>Excellent food. Lots of wines by glass. No reservations. Great 
              fried oysters & lobster bisque. Innovative, interesting fresh fish 
              dishes. </p> 

         
          <h3 class="rest">Chillingsworth<span class="restaddr">            2449 Rte 6A, 896-3640 </span></h3>          
            <p>We had a very expensive dinner that we were very happy with a few 
              years ago. Fixed price (big price) with about 7 courses, very elegant.</p>
        

         
          <h3 class="rest">Chillingsworth Bistro<span class="restaddr">            2449 Rte 6A, 896-3640</span></h3>          
            <p>The Bistro has a very pleasant garden room. They once rushed us 
              through a meal and we haven't been back. </p>
        

         
          <h3 class="rest">High Brewster<span class="restaddr">            964 Satucket Rd, 896-3636</span></h3>          
            <p>No longer serving dinner in 2001. Too bad: Served perfect food 
              and service in cozy antique dining rooms. The fixed price included 
              appetizer, entree and dessert. No one else cooked duck so well. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="rest">Mulligan's<span class="restaddr"> 832 Villages Dr, 
              896-8251</span></h3>
            <p>On the golf course, Mulligan's has a pleasant dining room. It's 
              casual and noisy, with lots of children. The food was competent, 
              with some interesting combinations but not special.</p>
            <h3 class="rest">Old Manse Inn<span class="restaddr">            1861 Rte 6A, 896-3149</span></h3>

              a year, on the last Monday evening of July, all the chefs in this 
              fine-dining town gather under a big tent. Over thirty restaurants 
              bring samples of dinner and desserts and wine and they don't run 
              out of anything. It's an elegant affair with a band playing and 
              everyone dressed to see and be seen. This charity event sponsored 
              by Monomoy Community Services (945-1501) is usually sold out. Call 
              early in the summer for reservations.</p>

              637B Main St, 945-5777</span></h3>
            <p>Pastries, subs, pizzas. Just the thing to pack for a picnic.</p>

              945-9123</span></h3>          
                  
            <p>An Italian bistro with Mediterranean food. Quite good. There's 
              also an informal restaurant, Benedetto's, with pizza-type food.</p>

         
          <h3 class="rest">Chatham Bars Inn<span class="restaddr">            Shore Rd, 945-0096</span></h3>          
            <p>The Inn has three restaurants. The food is solidly good, expensive, 
              and not real adventurous. The elegant dining room looks extremely 
              pleasant. We had a nice lunch at North Beach Tavern. At the beach 
              across the road, the Beach House Grill is the least formal.</p>
        
      
          <h3 class="rest">Chatham Candy Manor<span class="restaddr">         Main St, 945-0825</span></h3>          
            <p>It's not a restaurant, but you could skip dinner and concentrate 
              on their handmade truffles, turtles, fantasy fudge, chocolate-covered 
              fruits, praline scallops and even gumdrops and licorice.</p>
        
         
          <h3 class="rest">Chatham Squire<span class="restaddr">            487 Main St, 945-0945</span></h3>          
            <p>Outstanding seafood. Dark cook pub atmosphere. Chatham local year-round 
              place. </p>
        

         
          <h3 class="rest">Christian's<span class="restaddr">            443 Main St, 945-3362</span></h3>          
            <p>Trendy, expensive downstairs, and we have sometimes found it snobby, 
              but the food is very good. We haven't been there for a few years, 
              time to try it again.</p>
        


         
          <h3 class="rest">High Tide<span class="restaddr">            1629 Main St (Rte 28), 945-2582</span></h3>

          <h3 class="rest">Impudent Oyster<span class="restaddr">            15 Chatham Bars Ave, 945-3545</span></h3>          
            <p>Great lunches and we've had great dinners. Sometimes dinner feels 
              crowded and hectic. </p>
        

         
          <h3 class="rest">Queen Anne Inn<span class="restaddr">            70 Queen Anne Rd, 945-0349</span></h3>          <p>Formal and just right; pleasant drink on porch; very

          <h3 class="rest">Two Turtles<span class="restaddr">            11 Library Lane, 945-1234</span></h3>          
            <p>The menu sounds great but we and our friend Eunice both found the 
              service so incompetent we forgot the food. I do remember that they 
              couldn't find a cold bottle of white wine. More recently, 
              yet another person volunteered to me that the food and the service are
              incredibly horrible.</p>

          <h3 class="rest">Wayside Inn<span class="restaddr">            512 Main St, 945-3407</span></h3>          
            <p>On Main St, you can have lunch or dinner and watch the people from 
              the sidewalk patio. They also have interior dining. The menu looks 
              pretty plain, but we had a very tasty lunch there. </p>
        

         
          <h3 class="rest">Wequassett Inn<span class="restaddr">            Rte 28, 432-5400</span></h3>          
            <p>Perched on a hill above Pleasant Bay, the Wequassett Inn is elegant 
              and does everything right. We like to have a perfect lunch on the 
              patio overlooking the bay. Or dinner in the dining room which has 
              a wall of glass overlooking the bay.</p>
            <h3 class="rest">Outer Bar and Grille at Wequassett Inn<span class="restaddr"> 
              Rte 28, 432-5400</span></h3>
            <p> For lunch or dinner, sip a fancy drink and watch the sailboats 
              in Pleasant Bay. Sit at a table on the deck or inside, or relax 
              at the bar on the deck. For lunch I had seared sea scallops on haricots 
              vert with ginger-infused black bean vinaigrette. </p>

            <p>New in 1999, it's one of the few places for fine dining outside 
              on a patio (or inside). (No one will miss its predecessor, the Wheel 
              Haus.) The chef's experience includes time at the Impudent Oyster, 
              and he's fanatic about fresh ingredients. The gazpacho was the best 
              of the summer. My dentist, who's tried all these restaurants, singled
              out this one as the finest.</p>

            <p>Gourmet food and formality in the dining room (they also have a 
              casual bar). The menu looks great, and Anne has enjoyed the dinners, 
              but Robert always finds everything too salty. The service is a little 
              spotty too.</p>
        

        
            <h3 class="rest">The Beacon Room<span class="restaddr"> 23 West Rd,

            <p>Lunch or dinner in a cottage with fresh, well-prepared food. It

              "she-crab&quot;, steamed, fried, broiled (no raw bar). Lobster roll 
              with no filler. Very informal. Can bring your own booze. Steamers 
              great. Open 11-2 and 5-9, closed Mon.</p>

            <p>This fine restaurant seems to cater to an older crowd, but we decided 
              they know a good thing. My favorite seat is next to the window looking 
              onto a courtyard garden. The food and service seem unpredictable 
              -- sometimes we think it's great, sometimes mediocre. </p>

            <p>For years I avoided Cooke's because it looks like fast food, even 
              though it wins awards every year for its fried clams. In 1999 I 
              tried it and loved their crispy big fried clams and delicate onion 
              rings. The secret is in the light breading. It's now my favorite 
              fast food joint.</p>

            <h3 class="rest">Kadee's<span class="restaddr"> 212 Main St, 255-6184</span></h3>          
            <p>Sit outside on deck. Okay dinners. Great for rawbar and champagne 
              after the beach. They also make some fine stews after 5 p.m. In 
              2000, they disappointed us by closing from 3-5 pm, just when we 
              like an afternoon snack.</p>

              in restaurants, but I bet that will be a big improvement.</p>

            <p>Our worst new find of 1999 for informal lunch. I list it only to 
              mention that the lobster roll tasted kind of like old tuna salad, 
              the french fries were overdone and tasteless, the cole slaw was 
              soggy with salad dressing, and my husband can't even remember what 
              he ate. I thought the porch where we ate was pleasant, but Robert 
              says he smelled garbage. The service was fine. </p>

            <p>Millions of kids and noise, and we thought the seafood no better 
              than anywhere else. If it were real inexpensive, it might still 
              be a winner, but we could have gone to a finer restaurant for the 
              price. </p>

            <p>Some (but not I) will mourn the passing of &quot;Off the Bay&quot; 
              in this location. New in 1999, the Mahoney's is starting out with 
              a less ambitious menu emphasizing fresh seafood. Upscale grill and 
              bar ambiance. We had a pretty good dinner.</p>

            <p>New owners in 2000. The same rich earthy Italian food with a few 
              new twists. Now taking reservations -- and you may not get in without 
              one. Fantastic food, and high prices. Wines by the glass are featured.</p>

            <p>
            <p>Fine view of Town Cove from the dining room, and now they have 
              a good chef that serves upscale dinners to match the view. The back 
              deck is a great place to have lunch next to the water. An extended 
              family in 1997 rescued and began restoring this old wooden inn. 
              They are very nice people. The inn is open to walk through and see 
              how fantastic it now looks.</p>
